# Exploring the Myth of Scientific Support for the Theory of Black Intellectual Inferiority: My Reaction broken down in specific sections

The Trend of Falling Heritability Estimates


Overall, this section of the article serves as a means for Crane to disprove Jensen's previous claims which employed statistical analyses to estimate the heritability of IQ, through arguing that the statistical methods by which Jensen arrived at this conclusion as failing to be robust due to... 
1. Failure to account for how much environmental impact IQ
2. Possessing flawed data
According to Crane, this flawed data is a direct result of the use of twin studies in which identical twins with identical genetics are reared in different environments to identify how much of an impact genetics and/or environmental conditions influence a phenotypic representation within a person, in which Crane argues that there is no substantial research of this sort with the correlation between the twins and their IQ scores being significant, and the research which attests to possessing a significant correlation had some confounding variables within their experimental designs such as: the twins experiencing similar environmental conditions due to either being placed in different branches of the same family or attending similar schools. 

My Opinions:
Well beginning with Crane's primary objection to the data as a result of adoptive family environment not reflecting the overall societal environment, I'd say that this is a strange objection to make. This is because, a sample will never be a perfect representation of the entire population sample even after the presence of randomly assigning the twin participants to families. I cannot be too harsh in this criticism however because this is a relatively dated paper, and there has likely been research conducted later in time which attempted to answer a similar question with a larger and much more diverse sampling group. I'd be surprised if not because it shouldn't be that hard to expand the constraints of the sampling pool to include a variety of diverse temporary adoption environments. Unless of course... Crane was specifically looking for research which involved the American adoption system as the adoption environments which obviously isn't a good medium to look for expansive environmental conditions due to the environmental conditions of adoptive families being extremely regulated, so there's no real representation of an environment on either extremes of the SES.
