I just learned how to create a blog of my very through Rstudio as an assignment by my research mentor Dr. Matthew Crump. First I had to install the distill package, then restart the rsession I was previously on, and start a new project by selecting the distill blog template option. I managed to link it to my Linkedn account. After I push it to Github and make it a public repository, I will continue to use it to monitor and track my progress as I continue to conduct research and sharpen my coding skills


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
