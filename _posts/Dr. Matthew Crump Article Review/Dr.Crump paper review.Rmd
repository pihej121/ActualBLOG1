Since my last blog entry, I've gained a relatively larger understanding of the domain of contingency judgments in terms of what it means within the realm of cognitive psychology and learning, as well as grasped a better understanding of precisely how contingency judgments relates to correlative statistics through the use of the delta p calculation rule. I will attempt to code for an example of this delta p rule below.


```{r}
Outcomepairings<- matrix(c(25, 25, 25, 25), ncol=2, byrow = TRUE)
 colnames(Outcomepairings) <-  c("Outcome", "No Outcome")
 rownames(Outcomepairings) <- c("Cue", "No Cue")
Outcomepairings <- as.table(Outcomepairings)
Outcomepairings
```

In this example though it is a good deduction to claim that there is a randomized relationship between the event's presence or lack thereof and the presence of some output, or lack thereof, as a result of each outcome being equally likely to occur. My previous inquiry which consisted of my asking why a Pearson's Correlation wasn't used instead of the delta P rule was answered also, through the explanation by Dr.Crump that the delta P rule incorporates some components of the Pearson's Correlation into its calculations. 
Now, in respects of Dr.Crump's paper, I appreciated how well it simplified certain terms and concepts so even a laymen like me who has just began to research this topic could understand with ease, dare I say I wish he introduced this to us before the other paper. I am very interested in the contingency judgment experimental technique he developed, specifically I am curious about whether or not he or anyone else has utilized his procedure to apply Signal detection theory within the domain of contingency judgment. If not, I am certainly interested in doing so.
